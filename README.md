# Assignment 2 for cloud and cluster computing

## Introduction
In this project, our aim is to develop a software system that showcases the livability of Melbourne by analyzing and visualizing the twitter streaming data and historical data we harvested. 

To achieve superb performance of the system, we developed a cloud-based application that can harvest twitter data using twitter API powered by VMs across the MRC. In the following sections we will introduce the rationale and approaches of our data analysis, the technical details of the system and the final display of our analysis result.
